Package Management
=============

Using dpkg, apt, snap, and flatpak for installing packages.

--------------------
dpkg(Debian Package)
--------------------

dpgk has two problems:
* you have to download the package manually.
* it doesn't take care of the dependencies.

After downloading the package (.deb) file from a website run the following command:
```bash 
dpkg -i <package_name.deb>
```
### Example usage

To install discord:

Open the link [[Discord Download]](https://discord.com/download) and download the deb package. After that navigate to `~/Downloads` folder and run the following command:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i discord*.deb
```

sometimes dpkg may fail to install the package due to missing dependencies which you will have to install manually or use *apt* to fix the broken dependency problems. 

if that is the case then use the following command after a failed installation of *dpkg*:

```bash
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```
-----------------------------
Apt (Advanced Packaging Tool)
-----------------------------

### Install a Package

*apt* is smarter than *dpkg* as it downloads the packages and installs them along with their dependencies.
```bash
sudo apt install <package_name>
```

To install **htop** for example, run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install htop
```

notice that apt will install the package and all dependencies required.
### APT Repositories

Apt uses remote repositories to install packages. these repositories are a collection of packages that apt can search through and find packages to install.

apt uses a local cache to store the indices or location of packages in the repository.

Theses repositories get updated frequently and the index of each package will change; that is why we need to update the local cache before trying to install packages.

A list of the repositories that apt will use to install packages is stored at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources`
  To see the list of repositories use the following command:
 ```bash
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
 ```
open the link http://ps.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ to see the packeges available at this repo open `/pool/main`.

To update the repo cache use the following command:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Search For Packages

To search the local cache for packages use the following command:

```bash
apt search fastfetch
```
### To List Installed Packages

```bash
apt list --installed
```
### Display Package Info

```bash
apt show fastfetch
```
### Upgrade Packages
To upgrade the package use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```
this will upgrade the package to the latest version. 
Any old dependencies that are no longer 
required will remain  on the system. If you wish to remove these 
dependencies automatically, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

 you can also use the following command to remove unused packages from the system:
 ```bash
sudo apt autoremove
 ```
### Remove a Package

To remove a package use the following command:
```bash
sudo apt remove <package_name>
```

To remove **htop** for example, run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt remove htop
```

notice that apt will remove the package but not the dependencies it uses.

if you want a clean remove use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt purge htop
```

### apt options
to see all switches of apt:

```bash
apt -h
```
Most used commands:
  * **list** - list packages based on package names
  search - search in package descriptions
  * **show** - show package details
  - **install** - install packages
  - **reinstall** - reinstall packages
  - **remove** - remove packages
  - **autoremove** - automatically remove all unused packages
  - **update** - update list of available packages
  - **upgrade** - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
  - **full-upgrade** - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages
  - **edit-sources** - edit the source information file
  - **satisfy** - satisfy dependency strings


### Snaps
----------------------------------------

Snap packs the program and all its dependencies into a single bundle that runs more-or-less independent of the rest of the OS and all other programs.

**Snap enables you to run different apps that can have conflicting dependencies.**

install snap:

```bash
sudo apt install snapd
```

To install an app use the following command:

```bash
snap install firefox
```

To list all snaps installed, use the following command:

```bash
snap list 
```
### Flatpaks
another package distribution type is `*flatpak*`.
To add flatpack support to your system, use the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install flatpak
```
To add flathub repo to the system, use the following command:
```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```
Once Flatpak is installed and configured, restart your system. Otherwise, installed Flatpak apps won't be visible on your system menu.
Search for a Package
Either use Flathub website or use the following command, if you know the application name:
```bash
flatpak search <package-name>
```
### Example Flatpak Install


To search for Libreoffice:
```bash
flatpak search office
```
this will outoput the following:

```bash
OfficeFactoring App for Factoring, securitization, ESC or … com.serveftp.officefactoring       2.0.0        stable flathub
Finnish Spellc… Finnish spell checker, hyphenator and gram… …breOffice.BundledExtension.Voikko              stable flathub

```
the one we need is `org.libreoffice.LibreOffice`. The following command will
install the flatpak of libreoffice:
```bash
sudo flatpak install org.libreoffice.LibreOffice
```
to list installed flatpaks:
```bash
flatpak list
```
to remove libreoffice:
```bash
flatpak uninstall org.libreoffice.LibreOffice
```
